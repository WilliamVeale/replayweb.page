  ReplayWeb.page is a browser-based web archive viewer that loads and replays archived web content directly in your
  browser without requiring any server infrastructure.

  Project Overview

  Current Version: 2.3.16License: AGPL-3.0-or-laterRepository: https://github.com/webrecorder/replayweb.pageLive Site:

  What It Does

  ReplayWeb.page allows users to view and interact with archived web content from various archive formats including:
  - WARC (.warc, .warc.gz) files
  - WACZ (Web Archive Collection Zipped) files
  - HAR (HTTP Archive) files

  The application runs entirely client-side using a service worker architecture, meaning no data is uploaded to any
  servers and all content stays within your browser.

  Architecture
